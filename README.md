# Rusty NES

This is an implementation of the NES console, written in Rust.
My ultimate goal is to fully implement it so it can run original NES games.

Why Rust? Because why not write a blazingly fast emulator anyway? ⚡

Right now, I’ve just finished the CPU implementation, which reproduces the original MOS 6502 CPU.
Other components will be added step by step as I continue teaching and coding through my YouTube series.
